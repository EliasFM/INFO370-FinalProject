    "Within the last decade, the topic of gun violence and gun control has become a serious issue with opinions becoming very polar and political on what solution is the safest and most practicle for a modern America. Many people believe that the United States is in an arms race against itself and the need for citizen to carry firearms is obsolete. Others believe it is natural to want to protect yourself and your home with a firearm. \n",

    "We gathered data from a wide variety of sources in our research. The first source we used was from the Gun Violence Archive which provided key data on our primary variable of interest: gun violence. The [GVA](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org) was founded in 2013 to provide public data on mass shootings. This data provided a baseline for the timeseries of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source we used was the [National Criminal Background Check System](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/nics). From this source we extrapelated the total number of gun sales, which is our dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used population data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html#par_textimage) to normalize different features on the state level. Unfortunately, this data is yearly rather than monthly so it is not as accurate. However, we felt that this still accurately represented the population so we just used the yearly counts."

    "The data preperation was a three part process. The first step in preparing the data was to concatonate all of the mass shooting data by year into one dataframe. This was convienent since all of our data came from the same source. The second step focused on gun sales in the US. This data was also already packaged nicely, the only work needed was to split up the month and year to force them into integers for merging and totaling the counts for the US as a whole. Then, state population was added to the sales dataframe to later create features relative to population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step in creating the dataframe was to merge the shooting data with the gun sale data. Once that was complete, we were ready for feature selection. The first feature we decided to create was the number of people affected, which is simply number of people injured and number of people killed. Then to quantify large incidents we created a boolean that measured if over 10 people were affected in the incident. The next two features we added the average number of of deaths and injuries based on the number of incidents in each month. Finally, we normalized the values based on population of the state in which they occured."
